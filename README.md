This is a project which I made as my high school CS project.<br> 
As the name suggest it is based on the basic functionality of facebook.<br> 
It has basic facebook features like status, newfeed ,friend requests, messaging , like , dislike , comment etc <br>
All of this is implemented in C++ using data file handling.<br>
Will run perfectly in Turbo C++.
ok
